Test: mannwhitney_u
***Test assumptions:
Exactly one explanatory variable: drug
Exactly one explained variable: wedsBDI
Independent (not paired) observations: drug
Variable is categorical: drug
Variable has two categories: drug
Continuous OR ORDINAL (not nominal) data: wedsBDI

***Test results:
name = Mann Whitney U Test
test_statistic = 8.00000
p_value = 0.18404
adjusted_p_value = 0.09202
alpha = 0.01
dof = 3
Effect size:
A12 = 0.88889
Null hypothesis = There is no difference in medians between drug = Ecstasy and drug = Alcohol on wedsBDI.
Interpretation = t(3) = 8.00000, p = 0.09202. Fail to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.01. There is no difference in medians between drug = Ecstasy and drug = Alcohol on wedsBDI.The effect size is A12 = 0.88889. The effect size is the magnitude of the difference, which gives a holistic view of the results [1].
