Exactly one explanatory variable: Plant
Exactly one explained variable: uptake
Continuous (not categorical) data: uptake

Null hypothesis = There is no difference in medians between Plant = Qn1, Qn2, Qn3, Qc1, Qc2, Qc3 on uptake.
Interpretation = t(7) = 6.89813, p = 0.22833. Fail to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05. There is no difference in medians between Plant = Qn1, Qn2, Qn3, Qc1, Qc2, Qc3 on uptake.
