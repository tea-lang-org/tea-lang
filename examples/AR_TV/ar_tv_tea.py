Results:
--------------
Test: mannwhitney_u
***Test assumptions:
Exactly one explanatory variable: Condition
Exactly one explained variable: Score
Independent (not paired) observations: Condition
Variable is categorical: Condition
Variable has two categories: Condition
Continuous OR ORDINAL (not nominal) data: Score

***Test results:
name = Mann Whitney U Test
test_statistic = 442.50000
p_value = 0.03938
adjusted_p_value = 0.01969
alpha = 0.01969
dof = 26
Effect size:
A12 = 0.65459
Null hypothesis = There is no difference in medians between Condition = AR and Condition = TV on Score.
Interpretation = t(26) = 442.50000, p = 0.01969. Reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.01969. The median of Score for Condition = AR is significantly greater than the median for Condition = TV. The effect size is A12 = 0.65459. The effect size is the magnitude of the difference, which gives a holistic view of the results [1].
