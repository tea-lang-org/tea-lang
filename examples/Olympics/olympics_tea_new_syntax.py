Results:
--------------
Test: mannwhitney_u
***Test assumptions:
Exactly one explanatory variable: Sex
Exactly one explained variable: Weight
Independent (not paired) observations: Sex
Variable is categorical: Sport
Variable has two categories: Sport
Continuous OR ORDINAL (not nominal) data: Weight

***Test results:
name = Mann Whitney U Test
test_statistic = 11876698893.00000
alpha = 0.05
dof = 196594
Effect size:
A12 = 0.17880
Null hypothesis = There is no difference in medians between Sex = M and Sex = F on Weight.
Interpretation = t(196594) = 11876698893.00000, p = 0.00000. Fail to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05. There is no difference in medians between Sex = M and Sex = F on Weight.The effect size is A12 = 0.17880. The effect size is the magnitude of the difference, which gives a holistic view of the results [1].
